# Java Swing

## Overview

Java Swing is a part of Java's Standard Library used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of 'widgets' for creating windows, buttons, text fields, and other user interface elements. Swing is built on top of the older AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and offers a more sophisticated set of components and features.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight Components**: Swing components are written entirely in Java, which allows for a consistent look and feel across different platforms.
- **Pluggable Look and Feel**: Swing supports different "look and feel" options, allowing the appearance of the GUI to be changed dynamically.
- **Rich Set of GUI Components**: Includes buttons, labels, text fields, tables, trees, and more, each with various customization options.
- **Event Handling**: Provides a robust mechanism for handling user interactions through events and listeners.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Offers various layout managers to arrange components in a container, such as `BorderLayout`, `FlowLayout`, and `GridLayout`.
- **Custom Painting**: Allows developers to draw custom graphics on components using the `paintComponent` method.

## Advantages

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Swing applications can run on any platform that supports Java, providing a consistent user experience.
- **Rich Component Set**: Comes with a wide range of pre-built components, making it easier to create complex interfaces.
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Supports advanced features such as tabbed panes, toolbars, and complex tables with editable cells.

## Getting Started

To use Java Swing in your Java application, include the following import statements in your code:

```java
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JPanel;
import javax.swing.JTextField;
